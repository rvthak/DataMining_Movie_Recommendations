# DataMining_Movie_Recommendations
Introduction to data analysis and basic recommendations

An introductory assignment on Data Mining. We start by analyzing the provided dataset and extracting potentially useful information. 
Based on this information, we created Bow and TF-IDF representations for the available movies/series, and used them to provide basic 
content recommendations to the users (Based on their Jaccard/Tanomoto coefficients or their cosine similarities).

This project was developed in collaboration with Giorgos Farao (https://github.com/GeorgeFarao)
